What's good high powered "autist" or whatever
You geeks call it, I'm also a geek, but less technically
Competent. I need mentor in coding. I own 40 acres of what amounts
to a mad max set and I'm looking for ways to take advantage of the
Abundand free energy a available to me to power supercomputers that can help me
Solve problems on my gardens and orchards. Anyway
I need a mentor to shoot the shit with in terms of code
Because nobody learns a new language by talking to themselves.
